                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Dam Overflow Monitoring</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Early in the year, dam overflow monitoring was done mechanically. It was also a risky land that let the people live a dangerous life. 
                        Proper dam management systems have been causing several losses, including the recent floods. The objective we propose will be the application system with integration of the Internet of Things (IOT) to ensure the safety of the 
                        public in the prior alerting of flood incidence due to the increase in the water level in dams or lakes. 
                        The automatic comparison analytic for the increase in water level is noted. We want to build a system 
                        that can automatically alert the government as well as people if there is an overflow dam due to flooding. 
                        Finally, it will be observed that the level of accuracy is growing by cloud database technique in 
                        comparison with ordinary methods of monitoring and alerting systems. This system also includes 
                        features like SMS alerts to the people in the locality and higher authorities.p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Digital learning refers to the use of technology and digital resources to facilitate education and training. Digital learning has revolutionized traditional education by enabling remote access to educational materials, fostering flexibility in learning pace, and providing personalized learning experiences. It incorporates various technologies such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), educational apps, and multimedia content like videos, podcasts, and simulations. With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital learning also offers adaptive learning environments that cater to individual learner needs. The shift towards digital learning has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, making it a crucial component of modern education systems. However, challenges such as digital literacy, access to technology, and maintaining student engagement remain significant.</p>
